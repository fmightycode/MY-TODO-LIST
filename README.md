My TODOLIST app helps users to manage their time well and also helps in tracking their daily activities with track your progress feature. Users can create their own custom Todo list too. It was built on Node.js and connected to MongoDB atlas server.
Create your custom list by adding "/yourlist" to the home routes e.g localhost:3000/yourlist
